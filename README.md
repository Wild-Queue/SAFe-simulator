The pages are in the 'Pages' folder. The components of these pages are in the 'components' folder, and the small components and pop-ups are in the modals folder. The 'service' folder contains the cards (stories) for the third module. The 'Globals' contain info about cards in the second module. 'FirstModuleImages' and 'images' contain card images and programme images.

* In the 'components' folder in the RoadMap.jsx file, the command responsible for switching to module 3 has been commented out on line 119. If necessary, uncomment the line.
